                Velo go is a compact, lightweight cordless backpack vacuum cleaner fitted with a powerful motor to give users both
                complete freedom to clean and the power they need for maximum productivity.

                cleaning tool for both professionals and those wanting to achieve a professional quality clean at home.
                                <br>

                Velo go is equipped with a Hypercone 4-stage filtration system to leave air cleaner than it finds it, and an open
                disposable dust bag to ensure peak suction levels are maintained as the dust bag fills.
                                <br>

                Enjoy a powerful boost mode to give the user an extra surge of power to tackle even the most challenging cleaning tasks
                with ease.
                                <br>

                Designed with leading-edge, lithium-ion rechargeable battery technology, and engineered with a brushless motor, this
                battery backpack vacuum is a durable and enhanced performer with a long motor life.
                                <br>

                Enjoy the comfort of the supportive ecoharness and waistband, made by combining of high-quality materials with
                sustainable recycled textiles, resulting in an extra thick, padded harness.
                                <br>

                Made from at least 50% rPet (recycled polyethylene terephthalate), Pacvac is proud to offer a harness made from recycled
                plastic water bottles as part of their commitment to a more sustainable product offering.
                                <br>

                With adjustable shoulder and chest straps, we’ve designed this harness to give any user a tailored, comfortable cleaning
                experience.
